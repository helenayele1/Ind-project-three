Description
The Beep Boop Web App is a simple web application that takes a number as input from the user and generates a sequence of numbers with special substitutions. It replaces specific numbers based on the following rules:
* Numbers that contain a '1' are replaced with "Beep!"
* Numbers that contain a '2' are replaced with "Boop!"
* Numbers that contain a '3' are replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"
The substitutions are applied in order of heiarchy, with “Boop” taking priority over “Beep” if number 1 is before number 2. "Won't you be my neighbor?" taking precedence over "Boop!" and "Beep!".
